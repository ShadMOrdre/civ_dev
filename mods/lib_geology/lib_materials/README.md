# lib_materials

lib_materials is a massive collection of stone, dirt, sand, clay, liquid, and "grass" ground cover types.  A complete list can be found in the nodes.csv file, but be careful, as this file contains all the data necessary to load the node definitions.

Please be patient, there are bugs, and other oddities, but otherwise, I thinks you'll be impressed.

lib_materials includes code from default, valleys_c, ethereal, fluidity, buckets, and others.  Where included, those licenses apply.

Special thanks to Gael de Sailly, initially as inspiration from Valleys mg, but for the .csv code contribution that makes this run more efficiently.

Also, thanks to e7e7, for the biome dirts code generation.

Many thanks to all the other code contributors, whose code guided or has been included in this mod.
